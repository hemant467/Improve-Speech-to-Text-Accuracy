# Improve-Speech-to-Text-Accuracy 🎯
Automated Speech Recognition (ASR), also known as machine transcription or Speech-to-Text, uses machine learning to turn audio containing speech into text.
Machine learning systems rarely achieve 100% accuracy. The Google Speech Adaptation API, a feature within Speech-to-Text, is a method to enhance accuracy by providing context and hints. This is useful for recognizing specific words or phrases that might otherwise be misrecognized or have a lower probability of correct identification.
